Instructions:
-------------

1) Please download the PedestrianCountingSystemMonthlyCountsPerHour.zip and unzip into the folder of your choice.

2) Please download the data in CSV format (not included in the zip as it is too large) from https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Pedestrian-Counting-System-Monthly-counts-per-hour/b2ak-trbp. 
   Exporting it as 'CSV for Excel' would be fine and please place it in the PedestrianCountingSystemMonthlyCountsPerHour\BulkLoad\data folder.

3) The solution/project was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server Express version 10.0.2531.0. Please make sure you have compatible versions of Microsoft Visual Studio and 
   SQL Server installed on your machine also. SQL server 'Developer' or 'Express' edition would be fine.

4) Starting with the SQL scripts please read the readme.txt file in the PedestrianCountingSystemMonthlyCountsPerHour\Sql folder. Repeating it here just in case:
	- Please create a database in SQL Server called 'PedestrianCountingSystemDB'
	- Then please run all the scripts in order from 1 to 4
	- This should create the necessary tables and a stored procedure

5) Please update the App.config file in the PedestrianCountingSystemMonthlyCountsPerHour\BulkLoad folder as follows:
	- sqlServerConnection - please update this to your SQL Server connection information and database
	- dataFilePath - please update this to your data folder with Pedestrian_Counting_System_-_Monthly__counts_per_hour.csv file your have downloaded
	- errorFilePath - please update this to a folder where you would like to store the error log file for the ingestion of data
	- destinationTableName - if this is different, please update this too but should be the same based on the SQL scripts you have run

6) Please update appsettings.json in the PedestrianCountingSystemMonthlyCountsPerHour\DataApi folder as follows:
	- in 'ConnectionStrings' SQLServer row, update value to your SQL Server connection information and database
	
7) Please open the solution and then once the projects have loaded:
	- Set 'BulkLoad' project as a Starup project and please run it to ingest the data from the CSV file into the SQL Server table(s)
	- To run the Data Service, please set 'DataApi' as a Starup project and run it. In the browser 2 REST API Get methods will be available:
		- http://localhost:62755/data/ingestionStatus - this returns the status of the data ingestion (this could also be run during bulk upload)
		- http://localhost:62755/data/averageHourlyFootfallCount - this returns the average hourly footfall count by sensor and date result in JSON format
			- This gets calculated and returned, using a stored procedure underneath the scenes. Also this is stored in the AverageHourlyFootfall table to be available for query by other applications
